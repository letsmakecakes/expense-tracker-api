# Expense Tracker API

The **Expense Tracker API** is a RESTful service built with the Gin framework in Go. It provides endpoints to manage user credentials and track expenses, including features like JWT-based authentication, secure password hashing, and CRUD operations on expense records.

## Features

- **Authentication:**
  - User Signup and Login with JWT-based token generation.
- **Expense Management:**
  - Add, update, delete, and retrieve expenses.
  - Filter expenses by categories like Groceries, Electronics, etc.
- **Security:**
  - Passwords are hashed for secure storage.
  - Token validation with middleware for protected routes.

## Requirements

- **Go** (v1.20+ recommended)
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite** (as the database backend)
- **cURL** (for testing API endpoints)
- **Git** (for version control)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/letsmakecakes/expense-tracker-api.git
   cd expense-tracker-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` and update the following variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your database connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A secure secret key for JWT token signing

4. **Set up the database:**
   - Create a database for the project
   - Run the migrations from the `migrations/` directory

5. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   ```

## API Endpoints

### **Auth Endpoints**

| POST   | `/login`        | User Login (JWT Token)| No            |

### **Expense Endpoints**
| Method | Endpoint                | Description                 | Auth Required |

| POST   | `/expenseAPI/expense`   | Add a new expense           | Yes           |
| GET    | `/expenseAPI/expense`   | Get all expenses            | Yes           |
| GET    | `/expenseAPI/expense/:id` | Get expense by ID          | Yes           |
| PUT    | `/expenseAPI/expense/:id` | Update expense by ID       | Yes           |
| DELETE | `/expenseAPI/expense/:id` | Delete expense by ID       | Yes           |

## Environment Variables

| Variable       | Description                       | Required | Default |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------|---------|
| `PORT`         | Server listening port | No | 8080 |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Connection string for the database | Yes | - |
| `JWT_SECRET`   | Secret key for signing JWT tokens | Yes | - |
| `ENVIRONMENT`  | Application environment (development/production) | No | development |

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Use `.env.example` as a template and create your own `.env` file with your actual configuration values.

## Run Locally

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

2. **Access the API:**
   Visit `http://localhost:8080` to access the API.

## Testing with cURL

### **1. Sign Up**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/signup \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "testpassword"}'
```

### **2. Log In**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "testpassword"}'
```

### **3. Add an Expense**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/expenseAPI/expense \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"category": "Groceries", "amount": 50.75, "description": "Lunch", "date": "2024-11-13"}'
```

### **4. Get All Expenses**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/expenseAPI/expense \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"
```

## Security

This application handles sensitive user data and implements several security measures:

- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication for API access
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated to prevent malicious data
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration is managed via environment variables

### Security Best Practices

- Always use a strong, unique `JWT_SECRET` in production
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Never commit sensitive data like passwords or API keys to version control
